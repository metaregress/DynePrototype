# DynePrototype

A digital prototype of a game I worked on in college with a friend. One of the problems we ran into was mechanics that were pretty dang complicated for a tabletop game, so I figured I'd have a go at porting it to a digital medium and seeing how it felt.

Dyne.py is the main file. It usually contains an example scenario. For now it's just showing off functionality, until I can figure out how I want to handle input.
